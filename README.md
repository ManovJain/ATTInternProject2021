# ATTInternProject2021

## Created by Manov Jain for AT&T TDP Intern Innovation Challenge 2021


### What it does
This Python script was created to show that I was able to create a autonomous route generator, given a list of rides and shows, along with a user's viewing history. This was the idea behind my team's intern innovation challenge for the 2021 AT&T Internship.

### Languages and Libraries used:
1. Python
2. random
3. time


### How to run:

1. Clone this repo onto your local machine
2. Make sure you have Python v3.8 or above
3. Run using terminal or inside of an IDE. I used pycharm.
4. The MenuManager script will showcase the interactive menu!
